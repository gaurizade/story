Once upon a time, there lived a monkey on a mango tree on 
the banks of a river. The mangoes of that tree were the
 sweetest of all. The tree bore fruits year-round. 
 The monkey used to live very happily on the 
tree eating the tasty fruits and playing on the tree. 

The crocodile, having swum up quite a distance, was tired 
and hungry. The kind monkey sees that the crocodile is hungry and shares the berries with the crocodile. The crocodile eats the sweet berries, 
thanks the monkey, and goes back home.

The crocodile, having enjoyed the sweet 
berries that the monkey shared, goes back to the
 tree the next day. The monkey happily shares the
  fruits from the tree. They spend the entire day 
  talking and eating berries. Soon, the monkey and
   the crocodile became good friends and began to 
   trust 
each other.

thanks you
